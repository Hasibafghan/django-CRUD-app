- Create, view, update, and delete records
- Search records by various criteria
- Responsive UI with templates and static assets
- Image upload support for records
- Secure user authentication and session management

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd django-CRUD-app
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
- Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
